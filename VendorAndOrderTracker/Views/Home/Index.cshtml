      <h1>Vendor and Order Tracker for Pierre's Bakery</h1>
      <hr>
      <p>Pierre runs a bakery and needs to keep track of the vendors that purchase baked goods from him. He also needs to keep track of the orders belonging to each vendor.</p>
      <p>Here's where you come in! You can add the names of vendors to a list, and create orders for each vendor. You can then view a list of all of the vendors, and selecting a vendor name will display all of the orders for that vendor.</p>
      <h3><a href="/vendors/new">Add a new vendor</a></h3>

      <h3><a href="/vendors">View vendors</a></h3>
